# With renv 0.17.3, renv::status() throws an error for
# `assets/data/P12/PC/160424-N02A/` along these lines
# "too many files, consider ignoring this directory"
# So let's ignore the data tree and some other folders that don't contain
# any Rnw source files anyway.

# By default, ‘renv’ will read your project's ‘.gitignore’s (if any)
# to determine whether certain files or folders should be included
# when traversing directories. If preferred, you can also create a
# ‘.renvignore’ file (with entries of the same format as a standard
# ‘.gitignore’ file) to tell ‘renv’ which files to ignore within a
# directory. If both ‘.renvignore’ and ‘.gitignore’ exist within a
# folder, the ‘.renvignore’ will be used in lieu of the
# ‘.gitignore’.
# Using ignore files is important if your project contains a large
# number of files; for example, if you have a 'data' directory
# containing many text files.
