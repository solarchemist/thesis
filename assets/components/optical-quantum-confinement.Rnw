\chapter{Optical quantum confinement in low-dimensional ZnO}
\label{ch:quantum-confinement}

Chemistry graduates are commonly taught the concept of the triad of
\emph{structure}, \emph{composition}, \emph{property},
to underscore that a material's properties are determined by its
chemical structure and chemical composition.
While this is certainly true, it is not the whole truth.
There are other parameters along which a material's properties can
be tailored.
Nanosized semiconductor crystals, despite having the same structure and composition
as bulk materials, can have their electronic and optical properties
systematically controlled by just \emph{one} parameter: size.
This is caused by \emph{quantum confinement}, which opens up another way to tailor
the optical and electronic properties of semiconductors.

Quantum confinement effects can become apparent when the distance between allowed
energy levels exceed $kT$.
In semiconductors the \gls{Fermi_level} lies \emph{in} the \gls{band_gap},
and as the \gls{DOS} in the bulk is generally much smaller near the band edges,
confinement effects (splitting of energy levels) can remain apparent even for fairly
large particle sizes.
Contrast this to metals, where the \gls{Fermi_level} lies in the \emph{centre} of a band,
where the \gls{DOS} is usually large and the distance between energy levels
thus small even for very small particles \cite{Delerue2004}.
%
Quantum confinement is the effect wherein the energy level spacing (the potential difference
between energy levels) in the material increases as its particle size decreases.
Other phenomena are also affected as nanocrystals are shrunk \cite[p.\ 114]{Delerue2004},
such as
the spin-orbit coupling,
the electron--hole Coulomb interaction, and
the electron--hole exchange interaction,
but this chapter will limit itself to the quantum confinement effect.

Quantum confinement provides a way to perturb the semiconductor's band structure
by an (external) parameter, in this case the particle size,
which we have explored in this thesis.
But there are many other ways to perturb the band structure, for example by
external pressure (causing uniaxial strain in non-centrosymmetric structures),
or temperature, or electric field effects (Stark effects, ionization effects),
or magnetic field effects (Landau splitting, the Zeeman effect) \cite{Pankove1975}.
Common for all of them is that they require a sustained external force
(\ie, energy) to maintain the perturbation.
In contrast, the particle size is a permanent perturbation
of the material.


Based on the Schr√∂dinger equation, which shows that when particles become nanosized
the electronic states would be \emph{squeezed}, and based on the free-electron gas model
for metals, \textcite{Frohlich1937} predicted that nanoparticles would have very
different values of specific heat of their electrons compared to the bulk metal \cite{Linke2023}.
Although correct, observing this effect in metals would require exceedingly small
particle sizes (as we discussed above).
\textcite{Sandomirskii1963} was the first to point out that the effect of
quantum confinement should be more easily achievable in semiconductors (owing
to their smaller effective electron mass and thus larger \gls{exciton_Bohr_radius}),
and cause a measurable shift in the optical absorption edge.
By the early 1980s experimental observations of quantum effects in thin films
were well established \cite{Linke2023}, and was soon followed by evidence of
quantum size effects in \emph{colloidal} \glsdisp{NP}{nanoparticles} \cite{Brus1984a}.

In semiconductors quantum confinement can be approximately described by
a simple particle-in-a-box model and its most distinctive effect is that
the band gap becomes size dependent \cite{Law2004}.
This occurs when the dimension of the semiconductor is commensurable
or smaller than the diameter of its \glstext{exciton_Bohr_radius}, which results
in an increase of the exciton binding energy (caused by electron--hole-pairs
being forced closer together than in the bulk) \cite{Jimenez2016}
and the loss of translational symmetry (due to the smaller size of the particle),
causing a splitting of the energy levels instead of the continuous bands
in the infinite periodic solid.
The size at which this effect manifests itself for different materials depends
on their chemical composition
(actually the \glstext{exciton_Bohr_radius} which depends sensitively on
the effective mass of the electron which of course depends on the lattice
and its composition).

A particle that is quantum-confined along all three dimensions is called
a \glsdisp{QD}{quantum dot (QD)}, a 2D confined material is called a quantum wire
(or rod, depending on aspect ratio%
\footnote{%
   With regard to nomenclature, rods generally have a lower aspect ratio
   than wires, with the cutoff usually at \num{10} (although this definition
   is neither official nor always adhered to) \cite{Jeevanandam2018}.}%
), and a 1D confined material is a quantum well (ultrathin film).


An exciton is a quasiparticle made up of an electron and a hole in a bound state,
attracted to each other by the electrostatic Coulomb force.
In materials with large \glsdisp{relative_permittivity}{dielectric constant}
(such as semiconductors) the Coulomb interaction between electrons and holes
is effectively screened, generally causing excitons to have a radius larger than
the lattice spacing (so called Wannier--Mott excitons).
An exciton forms when a photon is absorbed by a semiconductor crystal,
generating an electron in the \gls{CB} and a hole in the \gls{VB},
and as the electron and hole relaxes across the \gls{band_gap} to recombine, the
energy released by recombination from the excited state back to the ground state
is the sum of three contributions, \namely,
the electron and hole confinement energy,
the exciton binding energy,
and the band gap energy \cite{Abdellah2015}.
%
The exciton binding energy is the energy difference due to the exciton
having slightly less energy than the unbound electron and hole
(this energy depends on the material).
And the confinement energy is due to the size of the particle literally
restricting the exciton's movement across the finite lattice which increases
its energy and thus its radius.
So by varying the size of a \gls{QD}, the confinement energy of the exciton
can be controlled, which in turn affects its transition probability and thus
its optical behaviour.

For a direct semiconductor (such as \ZnO) the optical quantum confinement is simply
the electronic quantum confinement, whereas for an indirect semiconductor (such as \hematite)
the optical quantum confinement is the combined effect of the electronic quantum confinement
and the vibrational quantum confinement \cite{Edvinsson2018}
(indirect transitions are not vertical in an energy-band diagram and thus involve
the nuclear coordinate; recall that phonons are effectively nuclear motions of freedom).

The exciton can be described as a electron (negative charge) orbiting a hole
(positive charge) at a certain radius, which is analogous to a hydrogen atom.
However, the exciton binding energy is much smaller and the exciton radius much
larger than the energy or Bohr radius of a hydrogen atom.
The \glsdisp{exciton_Bohr_radius}{exciton Bohr radius}, \glsname{exciton_Bohr_radius},
\marginpar{\scriptsize%
%\input{assets/aux/fig/fig_0500-probability-exciton-radius.Rnw}

}
can be expressed in terms of the hydrogenic radius, $a_0$:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:exciton-radius}
% https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/62274/how-do-i-write-%C4%A7-in-latex-for-the-reduced-planck-constant
\glsname{exciton_Bohr_radius} =
\frac{%
   \glsdisp{Planck_constant}{\hbar}^2\glsname{relative_permittivity}\glsname{vacuum_permittivity}}{%
   \mu\glsname{elementary_charge}^2} =
\frac{\glsname{relative_permittivity}}{\mu/\glsname{electron_mass}}\glsdisp{exciton_Bohr_radius}{a_0},%
\enspace\mathrm{where}~
\mu = \frac{\glsname{electron_mass}m_\mathrm{h}}{\glsname{electron_mass} + m_\mathrm{h}}
\end{equation}
where $\mu$ is the so called reduced mass, and \glsname{relative_permittivity}
is the dielectric constant of the semiconductor.

For bulk \ZnO, $\glsname{exciton_Bohr_radius}=\qty{2.3}{\nm}$
but can vary a lot depending on what values of effective masses are used
when calculating it.
Note that this radius defines the maximum on a \emph{probability distribution} function,
$P(r) = 4r^2/\glsname{exciton_Bohr_radius}^3\exp(-2r/\glsname{exciton_Bohr_radius})$,
which means that a majority (two thirds, to be precise) of exciton radii will actually
be larger than \glsname{exciton_Bohr_radius}, and one third smaller
(illustration in the margin shows $P(r)$ in the interval $0<r<5\glsname{exciton_Bohr_radius}$),
leading to quantum confinement effects being observed in systems even when their
average particle size is larger than the \gls{exciton_Bohr_radius}, as observed
in our own work (\cref{P3}) and by others \cite{Meulenkamp1998,Jacobsson2011}.

To describe this distribution of exciton radii, one speaks of different
\emph{confinement regimes}.
When the \gls{QD} size is larger than several exciton radii ($d\gg\glsname{exciton_Bohr_radius}$)
we are in the weak confinement regime, where the Coulomb interaction between the electron
and hole dominates, and thus the exciton is confined, but not the electron and hole
individually (the character of the exciton as a quasiparticle is conserved) \cite{Kayanuma1988}.
%
When the \gls{QD} size is smaller than the exciton radii ($d<\glsname{exciton_Bohr_radius}$)
we are in the strong confinement regime,
where the quantum confinement energy is much larger than the Coulomb interaction
and thus both the electron and hole are independently confined.
In this regime the electron--hole exchange energy is larger than
the spin--orbit interaction \cite[p.\ 115]{Delerue2004}.
%
The transition between the strong and weak regimes occurs when the \gls{QD} size
is approximately equal to the \gls{exciton_Bohr_radius},
$d/\glsname{exciton_Bohr_radius}\approx\numrange[range-phrase={\ensuremath{\sim}}]{1}{3}$.


As we have seen, in the quantum confinement regime the energy required to create excitons
will be larger than in the bulk and this energy will increase with decreasing particle size.
This means that by decreasing the particle size of a photocatalyst, we
can increase the reactivity of the photogenerated electrons and/or holes (depending
on whether both band edges shift with particle size).
Of course, by increasing the band gap we also further restric the amount of
solar photons the photocatalyst can absorb (\cf\ \cref{fig:solarspectrum-photoec}),
which may or may not be crippling.
%
The \glsfirst{band_gap}, of the photocatalyst in a quantum-confined system can be described as
a modification of the bulk band gap, $E_\mathrm{g,bulk}$ \cite{Edvinsson2018}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Eg-quantum-confined}
\Eg{} = E_\mathrm{g,bulk} +
   \frac{\glsname{Planck_constant}^2}{8R^2}\left(\frac{1}{m_\mathrm{e}^\ast} + \frac{1}{m_\mathrm{h}^\ast}\right) -
   \frac{1.8\glsname{elementary_charge}^2}{\glsname{relative_permittivity}R} +
   \frac{\glsname{elementary_charge}^2}{R}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\alpha_n\left(\frac{r_\mathrm{e} + r_\mathrm{h}}{R}\right)^{2n}
\end{equation}
where the second term is the increased kinetic energy of the electron--hole pair
due to being restricted inside a sphere with radius $R$
($m_\mathrm{e}^\ast$ and $m_\mathrm{h}^\ast$ are the effective mass of the electron and hole, respectively),
the third term is the Coulomb attraction in a screened environment,
and the fourth term is an average polarization
(where $\alpha_n$ is the polarizability, $r_\mathrm{e}$ and $r_\mathrm{h}$ the coordinate
of the electrons and holes with the particle) \cite{Edvinsson2018}.
As the particles grow and $R$ increases \glsname{band_gap} will approach $E_\mathrm{g,bulk}$.
This gives a physical motivation for a functional dependence between the
band gap, $\glsname{band_gap}/\unit{\eV}$, and the particle diameter, $d/\unit{\nm}$:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Eg-from-diameter}
\Eg{} = C_1 + \frac{C_2}{d} + \frac{C_3}{d^2}
\end{equation}
where the constants $C_1=\num{3.30}$, $C_2=\num{0.293}$, and $C_3=\num{3.94}$ were
determined in previous work by \textcite{Jacobsson2011}.
We utilized this model in \cref{P3} to estimate the band gap and particle diameter
of \ZnO\ \glsplural{QD} from a series of \gls{UV-Vis} spectra.

\Cref{eq:Eg-from-diameter} can be rearranged to express the particle diameter, $d/\unit{\nm}$,
in terms of the \glsdisp{band_gap}{band gap}, $\glsname{band_gap}/\unit{\eV}$:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:diameter-from-Eg}
d = \frac{2C_3}{-C_2 + \sqrt{C_2^2 - 4C_3\left(C_1 - \glsname{band_gap}\right)}}.
\end{equation}
The functional dependence between size and band gap is thus $d\propto\glsname{band_gap}^{-1/2}$.
In \cref{results:P21-tracking-growth-ZnO-QDs} I investigated the \ZnO\ \gls{QD} growth
over time based on this relationship.


Several material properties are expected to depend strongly on particle size
in quantum confinement regime.
Apart from optical and electronic properties, which matter greatly for a
photocatalyst, particle size will also affect phonon modes and exciton--phonon coupling,
which I have explored in \cref{P4} (for particle sizes above the weak confinement regime).


Literature suggests that the exciton binding energy is usually smaller than the
lattice vibrational energy (LO phonons) in many semiconductors \cite{Adachi1999a},
which is supported by our findings in \cref{P4} ($E(\mathrm{LO})=\qty{71.33+-0.05}{\meV}$
for the smallest particle sizes studied, \cf\ \cref{fig:P25-UVRaman-meanLOLO-vs-diameter}),
but only by about \qty{10}{\meV} if we assume the commonly cited \ZnO\ exciton binding energy
of \qty{60}{\meV}.
