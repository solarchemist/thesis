\label{box:light-sources}

To maintain a stable power density on the irradiated sample it is always
advisable to allow the light source sufficient time to warm up before starting
the measurement, in order for any filament to reach its working temperature,
or heat transfer across a sink to reach equilibrium, \etc.
If the light is not too bright nor too dim, the evenness of the produced patch
can easily be judged simply by looking at it.
Evenness can be improved considerably by adding suitable optics in the light path.
Light sources are commonly rated by their power draw, but this says
nothing about the intensity of the produced light nor its spectral
distribution.
It is therefore important to measure both the power density of the lamp
(which depends on the distance) and its spectral distribution.

In contrast to natural sunlight, we can tailor the spectral output of a lamp
to suit a particular application, \eg, a wide gap semiconductor might be
put under illumination of a \gls{UV} lamp. Since light is effectively a reactant
in a \gls{PC} reaction, this can significantly increase its throughput.

Philips PL-S BLB/2P \gls{CFL} black light
with a power draw of \qty{8.6}{\watt} and producing
\qty{1.65}{\watt} \glsdisp{UV}{UV-A}
centered at \qty{370}{\nm} and with less than \qty{0.2}{\percent} \glsdisp{UV}{UV-B},
according to the manufacturer's datasheet.
This kind of lamp has the form-factor of a consumer-grade \gls{CFL}, is cheap and
easy to source but produces very little visible light (hence the name).
But because the light source itself is about a decimetre long
and half as wide, the power density even very close to the lamp was very low,
which made it unsuitable for our \gls{PC} experiments.

Our blue \gls{LED} was a custom-made array with \num{49} surface-mounted blue
\glsplural{LED} with an integrated heatsink and fan (branded \enquote{Allray}).
Spectral output was centered at \qty{450}{\nm}
with \glsxtrshort{FWHM} of $\qty{20}{\nm}$ and a
power draw of \qty{50}{\watt}.
We measured power density at the distance of the sample (\cf\ \cref{{fig:0400-pc-blue-vertical-with-condensers}})
to \qty{34(4)}{\mW\per\square\cm}.

The Oriel Instruments Newport 67005 solar simulator
used a xenon arc filament and an \gls{AM15G} optical filter
to produce \qty{100}{\mW\per\square\cm} at the sample
(\hlink{https://solarchemist.se/2016/04/23/lamps-filters}{see blog for details}).

The bottom-left panel shows a typical white \gls{LED} emission spectrum,
here represented by a Perkin-Elmer ACULEDâ„¢ with a colour temperature of \qty{6500}{\kelvin}.
This spectral distribution is typical for
\ch{GaN} (emitting at \qty{465}{\nm}) and
\ch{Ce^{3+}:YAG} (\ch{Ce}-doped yttrium aluminium garnet) acting as a phosphor
emitting a broader Stokes-shifted yellow light. This sort of white light suffers
from \enquote{blue overshoot} and a \enquote{cyan gap},
which new materials based on perovskite nanostructures aim to overcome \cite{Peng2023}.

The high-pressure mercury arc filament can sustain very high intensities
(commercially known as a \enquote{tanning lamp}). Here showing the emission of a
Philips HPA 400S high-pressure mercury lamp (\qty{400}{\watt}).
Apart from broad \gls{Vis} emission it also outputs lots of \glsdisp{UV}{UV-A}
and heat.
